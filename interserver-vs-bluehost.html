                <p class="text-slate-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    <strong>Bluehost is great at marketing, but terrible at long-term value.</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    They lure you in with a $2.95/mo teaser rate, but force you to pay for 3 years upfront. When that
                    term ends, your price skyrockets to <strong>$10.99/mo or more</strong>. Plus, they charge extra for
                    things that should be free, like site backups and malware protection.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>InterServer</strong> is the honest alternative. You pay $2.50/mo. You can pay monthly. And
                    most importantly, your price is <strong>LOCKED</strong>. It renews at $7.00/mo forever. No massive
                    hikes. Plus the servers are significantly faster (LiteSpeed vs Apache).

                <h3>The Great Marketing Illusion</h3>
                <p>
                    If you search for "best web hosting" on Google, you will see Bluehost everywhere. Why? because they
                    pay the highest affiliate commissions in the industry. Most "reviewers" recommend them simply
                    because they get paid the most to do so.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But popularity does not equal quality. In fact, in the hosting world, it's often the opposite. When
                    a host gets too big (like Bluehost), they stop innovating. They get acquired by investment firms
                    (Newfold Digital) who focus on squeezing every penny out of customers rather than improving server
                    speeds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    InterServer is independent. They built their own datacenter in New Jersey. They didn't sell out. And
                    that difference is felt in every aspect of their service.
                </p>

                <h3>1. The "Renewal Price" Scam: Do The Math</h3>
                <p>
                    This is the single most important reason to choose InterServer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Bluehost Model:</strong> They show you a price of $2.95/mo. Awesome, right?
                    <br>
                    <strong>The Catch:</strong> You MUST pay for 36 months upfront to get that price. That's a $106.20
                    bill on day one.
                    <br>
                    <strong>The trap:</strong> After 3 years, your account auto-renews. But not at $2.95. It renews at
                    the "regular rate" of $10.99 - $14.99/mo. Your bill suddenly jumps to hundreds of dollars.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>InterServer Model:</strong> The price is $2.50/mo.
                    <br>
                    <strong>The Catch:</strong> There is no catch. You can pay monthly.
                    <br>
                    <strong>The Lock:</strong> Their "Price Lock Guarantee" means the price you sign up with is the
                    price you keep for the standard web hosting plan. It is currently locked at $7.00/mo for renewal. It
                    doesn't triple.

                <h3>2. Speed: LiteSpeed vs Legacy Apache</h3>
                <p>
                    Bluehost runs on legacy Apache web servers. While reliable, Apache struggles when thousands of user
                    request a site at once. To combat this, Bluehost aggressively "throttles" CPU usage. If your site
                    gets a small traffic spike, Bluehost might actually take your site offline temporarily to "protect
                    the server."
                </p>
                <p>
                    InterServer uses <strong>LiteSpeed Enterprise</strong>. This is a modern server technology that cuts
                    page load times in half compared to Apache. It handles traffic spikes effortlessly.
                </p>
                <ul class="space-y-4 mb-8">
                    <li class="flex items-start">
                        <span class="text-green-500 font-bold mr-2">✓</span>
                        <div>
                            <strong>InterServer:</strong> Optimized specifically for WordPress with LiteSpeed Cache
                            (LSCache) enabled at the server level.
                        </div>

                    <li class="flex items-start">

                        <div>
                            <strong>Bluehost:</strong> Uses standard caching which is often not enough for media-heavy
                            sites.
                        </div>

                </ul>

                <h3>3. The Hidden Fees: Backups and Migration</h3>
                <p>
                    Imagine this: You work on your website for months. Then, you accidentally date an update and break
                    it. You need to restore a backup.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>With Bluehost:</strong> "Sorry, you didn't pay for the CodeGuard Basic add-on ($2.99/mo). We
                    don't have a backup for you." Or they might charge you a $150 fee to restore it manually.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>With InterServer:</strong> They keep daily backups of your site automatically. You can
                    restore them yourself from the control panel. For free.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>What about moving your site?</strong>
                    <br>
                    Bluehost often charges $149.99 for a "Professional Migration." InterServer moves your site for free.
                </p>

                <h3>4. Security: InterShield vs "UpsellShield"</h3>
                <p>
                    Bluehost's security strategy feels like a shakedown. When you sign up, they try to scare you into
                    buying "SiteLock Essentials." If you don't buy it, and your site gets malware, they shut you down
                    until you clean it (which often involves paying a service).
                </p>
                <p>
                    InterServer includes <strong>InterShield</strong> for free. It is an in-house security solution that
                    blocks web attacks, scans for viruses, and includes a machine-learning firewall.

                    <strong>The "Inter-Insurance" Policy:</strong> If your site successfully gets hacked while on
                    InterServer, their team will clean it up and restore it. For free. Bluehost simply does not offer
                    this.

                <h3>5. Dashboard: cPanel vs Custom Skins</h3>
                <p>
                    Bluehost uses a heavily modified version of cPanel. It looks pretty, but it's often slow and filled
                    with ads for their other services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    InterServer provides standard DirectAdmin (or cPanel on request). It's clean, fast, and utilitarian.
                    It doesn't try to sell you things; it just lets you manage your files, emails, and databases.
                </p>

                <h3>Final Verdict: Why we dropped Bluehost</h3>
                <p>
                    We used to recommend Bluehost years ago. But the constant price hikes, the declining support
                    quality, and the slow servers made it impossible to suggest them in good conscience.

                    <strong>InterServer is the "Hidden Gem" of the hosting industry.</strong> They aren't famous because
                    they don't spend millions on Superbowl ads. They just provide a rock-solid service at a price that
                    essentially hasn't changed since 1999.

                <p>
                    If you want to start a website without worrying about being ripped off three years from now, the
                    choice is obvious.
